# ENGR-1181-Team-C-SDP

Executive Summary:
This software design project or SDP main goal is to teach students problem-solving strategies, the design process, and programming skills learned in MATLAB through the year to produce a functioning video game of their choosing. Team C has created this website which is intended to show the progress of the SDP project they have created which is the game 2048. Each team had to create a game using MATLAB while documenting the entire project. The chosen game can range from super simple such as over under 7 to a very complex game such as 2048 or chess. Students were required to reach a minimum complexity score of 2 but were able to be awarded extra credit if they chose a a game with more complexity points or constructed multiple games. The students were given a Simple Game Engine to make the graphics within MATLAB to help simplify the front end while mainly focusing on the backend logic. 

In the software design project, the team was able to successfully code 2048 and in addition to that, they also coded the game Rock Paper Scissors for additional bonus points. To test the games they had to ask their peers to play the game and were able to play the game and experience the thrill of playing. There were some struggles along the way when figuring out what type of loop should be used to better suit the application. Another issue the team encountered was coding a large potion without checking if a specific part worked before continuing to the next section of the game. This led to a lot of extra time spent troubleshooting because they didn't know where the error was coming from within the code. 

Throughout the software design project, the development of the 2048 game involved a comprehensive approach to programming and problem-solving. The implementation of the game successfully captured the essence of the original 2048 game, offering an engaging and challenging experience for players.  The project allowed for the application and enhancement of programming skills, particularly in algorithmic thinking and user interface design. However, with more time for development, additional features could be incorporated, such as customizable themes, advanced scoring mechanisms, and varying difficulty levels. A full-scale production of the game might involve optimizing the code for different platforms and devices, ensuring a seamless gaming experience across a broader audience. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into game development and highlighted the potential for continuous improvement and expansion if pursued further.
